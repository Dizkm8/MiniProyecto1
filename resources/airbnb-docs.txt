#neighborhood: As with borough: a subregion of the city or search area for which the survey is carried out. For cities that have both, a neighbourhood is smaller than a borough. For some cities there is no neighbourhood information.
#reviews: The number of reviews that a listing has received. Airbnb has said that 70% of visits end up with a review, so the number of reviews can be used to estimate the number of visits. Note that such an estimate will not be reliable for an individual listing (especially as reviews occasionally vanish from the site), but over a city as a whole it should be a useful metric of traffic.
#overall_satisfaction: The average rating (out of five) that the listing has received from those visitors who left a review.
#accommodates: The number of guests a listing can accommodate.
#bedrooms: The number of bedrooms a listing offers.
#price: The price (in $US) for a night stay. In early surveys, there may be some values that were recorded by month.
